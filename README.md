Yelp Intelligent Review Ranker
==============

This project optimizes the review highlight section in Yelp by tailoring suggestions according to user taste-profile as well as review informativeness. By applying collaborative filtering techniques, it uncovers hidden tastes of Yelp reviewers using their review history as well as restaurant attributes. A cross-validated predictive model automatically selects the three most usefulness reviews and presents them in descending order according to user-similarity.
